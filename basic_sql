Basic commands:

SELECT

select *from Table_Name;
  It is used to project name of all column of a table. * can be replaced by the name of the attribute which you want
to display. The result of the above command is stored in a table called result-set. 

select distinct Column_name from Table_Name;
  The above command is used to select distinct elements from the table. The duplicate values are removed by using
above command. 

WHERE 
  Where clause puts conditions on the values returned by the select statement.
select *from Table_Name where Column_Name = 'abc';
  The above statement prints only those columns where the column has the values 'abc'. Various operators which can 
be used with where clause are :
  1. = (Equal)
  2. <> (Not equal, in some versions it can be represented as !=)
  3. LIKE (Searching for a pattern)
  4. IN (Checks in range)
  5. BETWEEN (Checks from a value v1 to value v2)
  
ORDER BY 
  It is used to sort the column names. 
select *from Table_Name order by Column_Name;

INSERT INTO 
  It is used to insert values into the database table. It has two forms :
   1. insert into Table_Name values (val1, val2);
   2. insert into Table_Name (col1, col2) values (val1, val2);
